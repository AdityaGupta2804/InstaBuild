1. in docker_executor.py we have hardcoded "node:18" which is the type of image we want to use for our test project,-
    solution -: we can take image type form yaml file ,
2. In backend/utils/notifier.js we have hardcoded dicord webhook so we need to change that to user input
3. Also need to add NEW URL button on dashboard to take url from ui rather than postman


| Approach       | Pros                           | Cons                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **REST API**   | Easier to debug, more control  | Manual packaging of build dir                  |
| **Vercel CLI** | Quick to set up, very reliable | Requires `vercel` installed, harder to monitor |

⚠️ But You Have a Bug
In this line:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!fs.readFile(logsPath)) {
You're using fs.readFile() without awaiting it or using a callback, which is incorrect. This will not check if the file exists.
